🛡️ AEGIS v21.0: Sovereign Livestock OS
Precision Agriculture for the Modern African Farmer
Developed by: Eric Kamau | AEGIS Project Affiliation: University of Nairobi (UoN)

Vision: Innovation for Humanity

📖 Project Overview
AEGIS is a high-integrity Decision Support System (DSS) built to eliminate guesswork in livestock management. By integrating Nutritional Science (Pearson Square), Predictive Analytics (Linear Growth), and Clinical Triage, AEGIS transforms a farm into a data-driven enterprise.

This isn't just a record-keeping app; it is a Biological Operating System designed for the Kenyan agricultural landscape.

🚀 Key Engineering Modules
1. 🧪 Optimizer Pro (Nutritional Intelligence)
Utilizes the Pearson Square Algorithm to formulate balanced rations using local ingredients (Maize Bran, Omena, Cotton Seed Cake). It ensures the Crude Protein (CP) requirements are met at the lowest possible cost.

2. 🧬 Fertility & Vax Sentinel (Biological Forecasting)
Heat Prediction: Uses a 21-day biological cycle logic to predict peak fertility windows.

Vaccination Engine: Automatically maps out a lifetime immunity schedule based on the species-specific Kenya Veterinary protocols (FMD, CCPP, LSD).

3. 🩺 Professional Health Triage
A systemic clinical diagnostic bridge that uses rectal temperature, respiration rates, and mucosal color to categorize health risks into Red (Emergency) or Yellow (Urgent) alerts.

4. 📈 Market Intelligence & ROI
Predicts future asset valuation by calculating the Average Daily Gain (ADG) and projecting it against current Kenyan market prices.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Framework: Streamlit (Web Interface)

Data Science: Pandas (Data Structures), NumPy (Calculus)

Visualization: Altair (Interactive Growth Charts)

API Integration: OpenWeatherMap (Climate-driven disease risk modeling)

Security: Base64-encoded Cloud Snapshots
